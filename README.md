## About the Video Course
	
Are you looking for an easy way to set up a local-hosted JSON server? This course is designed to help you set up and learn JSON and AJAX. You'll use it locally on your own machine and practice working with AJAX and JSONâ€”all from your computer. No CORS errors, no problems; everything will be done locally. This course is designed to help you learn and practice JSON and will walk you through setting up a JSON Server. This will give you a fully functional JSON database that you can use to practice JSON and AJAX. This course covers the basics of XHR requests in JavaScript and how to GET and POST data. Then, you'll learn how to make XHR requests, see database updates directly in your editor, and view the JSON database. Further, you'll find out more about tools and resources that are used to make XML HttpRequests in JavaScript. JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types. It is a very common data format used for an asynchronous browser-server communication, including as a replacement for XML in some AJAX-style systems. By the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge you need to set up JSON locally and AJAX with JavaScript.
